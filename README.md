## Intro

I'd like to make a gtd soft with multi functions, including task management, sync to calendar, time consume statistics, etc.

This soft runs at Google Cloud Platform. The Json communication func will be added to meet the requirement of mobile apps.

## Installation
In order to run this app locally, you neet to install google-cloud-sdk first.

Once installed, you can run by command:

`[path to google-cloud-sdk]/bin/dev_appserver [path to gtdcomplete]/.`

## Progressing
1. Task magagement almost done. 2017-09-13

## TODOs
1. Snyc with calendar
2. Time consume Statistics
3. Json communication interface
